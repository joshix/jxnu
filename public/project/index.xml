      <description>Mb &amp;ndash; New version, new name, 2011-04-22
Elaborations on the theme of anothy&amp;rsquo;s original tweet. Occasionally useful as prototype API poking sticks during development of larger clients for other systems — and of course to keep up with the web joneses from the comfort and safety of Plan 9.
These files are available in the Bell Labs Plan 9 sources contrib area, i.e., /n/sources/contrib/josh/rc/mb.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Identilion&amp;rdquo; began as a five minute hack to make NatsuLiphone, an open source iOS Twitter client, work with our federated Statusnet instance at Utopian.net. It took about 2 minutes to change the URL strings, the other 3 to rename things so that both apps could run on the same iPhone. My mutant version was originally referred to as Lionica, a name that persists in the branch for the Identilion source code.</description>

      <description>NAME weather &amp;ndash; know which way the wind blows
SYNOPSIS weather [ air ] [ st ]
DESCRIPTION Weather prints the local conditions and seven-day forecast most recently reported at the US airport with the three–letter location identifier air. Given a two–letter US state abbreviation st instead, weather prints a table of air location identifiers known for st.
The arguments are mutually exclusive and case–insensitive. If neither is given, air defaults to location identifier ewr, designating the Newark, NJ, airport near Bell Labs, Murray Hill.</description>
