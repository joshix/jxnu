      <description>I updated the simple Plan 9 microblogging scripts, mb(1), not often but sometimes also called &amp;ldquo;microbe&amp;rdquo;, and almost never known as &amp;ldquo;meekroh-bee&amp;rdquo;.
All file and environment variable names have changed since the last release (c.2009, AD), replacing the &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; character micro (HTML’s &amp;amp;micro;, &amp;micro;, µ) with a plain m.
The awk | sed filter pipeline at the center of any useful improvement was taken from Stanley Lieber’s tw Twitter script.</description>

      <description>Mb &amp;ndash; New version, new name, 2011-04-22
Elaborations on the theme of anothy&amp;rsquo;s original tweet. Occasionally useful as prototype API poking sticks during development of larger clients for other systems — and of course to keep up with the web joneses from the comfort and safety of Plan 9.
These files are available in the Bell Labs Plan 9 sources contrib area, i.e., /n/sources/contrib/josh/rc/mb.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Identilion&amp;rdquo; began as a five minute hack to make NatsuLiphone, an open source iOS Twitter client, work with our federated Statusnet instance at Utopian.net. It took about 2 minutes to change the URL strings, the other 3 to rename things so that both apps could run on the same iPhone. My mutant version was originally referred to as Lionica, a name that persists in the branch for the Identilion source code.</description>
