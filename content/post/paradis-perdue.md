<i>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin:<br />and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</i> - James 1:15<br /><br />At last this odious offspring whom thou seest<br />Thine own begotten, breaking violent way<br />Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain<br />Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew<br />Transform'd: But he my inbred enemy<br />Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart<br />Made to destroy: I fled, and cried out, Death;<br />Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sigh'd<br />From all her caves, and back resounded, Death.<br /><br />
