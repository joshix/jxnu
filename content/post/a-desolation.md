"A rich enemy excites their cupidity; a poor one, their lust for power. East and West alike have failed to satisfy them.... To robbery, butchery, and rapine, they give the lying name of "government"; they create a desolation and call it peace." -- Calgacus, in speech to the assembled Britons, from Tacitus, <em>The Agricola</em>
