*Kansas City/Paros. November 2005.*

Not every night is different  
most begin with much the same choreography  
a geometry of sky folding closed and Sound  
thrown out of a day’s dance with the wind  
when Silence cuts in.  

Stars pick out jasmine’s shadow negative against  
their black matting, their paper backing, where  
<!--more-->
tonight it seems Orion aims his dart on a course  
straight through the red heart of Mars and into  
the moon’s sickly face for a trick shot.

As that pierced moon you have moved through  
vast darkrooms bigger than this ocean-mirror sky  
carrying photographs to be finished  
on the process you invented in the bath one night  
that the Kodak folks finally shook you down for. Tonight’s  
moon would not brighten these gaping vault closets with  
futile red lights and no poster on the bulwark walls  
of this shadowbox could reduce the dimensions.

Rooms too big and black for living or falling asleep in,  
walls too high for leaping, but you have a chance  
to throw your hat over and you see that  
the guests walk with the stiff steps of the uninvited  
before you realize you arrived right on time  
fit the dress code on the placard to a tee  
but when trying to leave looked for nickels or dimes lost  
in the funnel to the sewer line beneath the carpet  
laid by man for dogs and nuns treading separately  
past the case that locks the dirty negatives and  
the chemicals. (You should not breathe these.)

You thought your lab partner stood near the other end’s exit  
to pull on the string with the clothespins and things  
that aren’t pictures yet hanging. “Why won’t you pull  
the line away from me? I can’t push it.  
Are you reeling now?  
Can you hear me? Is it so dark that you’re deaf?  
If so you won’t have noticed the noise that hides you.  
Or are you raiding some other pantry?” (that will be  
such broad blackness just like this one  
with all the same mundane dunking, dousing,  
pressing, printing, hanging, cutting machines.)

The door you must find by feeling and no  
lightswitch sits near the jamb it’s in  
But finally you get out as you got in, but thinking  
as you push your head through the exit that  
These marbles are plaster made forgetful  
massaged with chisels until depicting  
just the one thing but with the advantage of angles  
in the light tonight’s moon shines they define subtlety.
