I bought some cigarettes with a coupon. I've only done this once or twice before because buying your addictive drugs with a coupon seems less than shabby and none of my other dealers even take them, but Mr. R.J. Reynolds mails them to me. Direct.<br /><br />Because they're mailed to me, the coupons have my name printed on the back. The cashier, who I call Quetzlcohotl, read my name on the coupon. Now she had a name for me.<br /><br />Do you know Stephanie Wood?, she demanded.<br /><br />I wasn't biting. I didn't like her tone. I said, I don't know too many people around here. I'm originally from Kansas City.<br /><br />Oh she's from the desert, too, explained the cashier.<br /><br />
