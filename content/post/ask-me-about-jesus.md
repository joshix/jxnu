<b>I</b><br />I never answer the phone. Yet I get up and eye the caller ID every time it rings. It could say Obama or Lindsay Lohan or Marshall Michel Ney on there, I would still leave it to voicemail. But I always check the caller ID. I never check the voicemail.<br /><br />I didn't name Jesus as a potential extraordinary caller because I live in Southern California and Jesus calls every once in a while.<br /><br /><b>II</b><br />I was smoking in the car in the Post Office lot while someone retrieved my mail. A blue Nissan Rogue pulled in next to me. It sported a bumper sticker: <i>Ask Me About Jesus</i>. So when the driver got out, I did. I said, What about Jesus?<br /><br />She looked at me with her mouth just open and brows raised. She didn't say a word.<br /><br />You're the one with the bumper sticker, I replied. She turned for the Post Office. She didn't hold the door for the exiting pregnant woman she met on her way in.<br /><br />
