A blue Nissan Rogue pulled in next to me. It sported a bumper sticker: *Ask Me About Jesus*.

When the driver got out, I did. I said, What about Jesus?

He looked at me with his mouth just open and brows raised. He didn't say a word.

You're the one with the bumper sticker, I replied. He turned for the Post Office.
