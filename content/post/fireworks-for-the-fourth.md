I saw fireworks over Big Bear Lake. They were accompanied by the local radio, 93.3 FM. We heard <em>Rocking in the USA</em> by Johnny Cougar Mellencougarcampencougar, <em>America</em> by Neil Diamond, <em>Ride of the Valkyries</em> by Wagner, <em>Wonderful World</em> by Louis Armstrong, <em>Man of Constant Sorrow</em> from the <em>Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?</em> soundtrack, and <em>Big Bear Lake</em> by Mel Blanc, who voiced it as the mutant offspring of Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig, far as I could tell. A sizable crowd at the Pine Knot landing idled and waited and wondered if the show would be more than the moving blue bow lights of boats on the lake.<br/><br/>Then the rockets' red glared, the bombs burst in air, and children twirled chemical green glowsticks to induce seizures in their friends. It was 68 degrees Fahrenheit at 9 PM. I walked back to the car in a sprinkle of sputtering uncertain mountain rain.
